  ## Description
  This is a simple calendar application that allos a user to save events for each hour of a full day.  The app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and dayJS.  The work day is defined in this application as 9AM to 5PM to help optimize work-flow and work-life balance. It also updates each hour to reflect how far along the day has gone and what tasks they still have coming up using intuitive color coding.
